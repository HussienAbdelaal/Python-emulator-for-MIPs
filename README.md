# Python-emulator-for-MIPs
a python script that emulates the MIPs 8-bit architecture.
it emulates about 22 assembly instructions -using regular expressions-
it emulates the program counter register, register file, input&output ports, reset pin and a 64Kbyte memory
it will inculde more commands and a GUI to check each register with each instruction soon enough ;)
